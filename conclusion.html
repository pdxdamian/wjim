      <h2>Significance and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    Looking into the youth is important for any sport, but one that has been neglected has been motorsport. There are few articles that look into the importance of go-karting and how these children are transferring to a higher level. Looking more into this part of motor racing will give a perspective on who are the children that are graduating to a higher level and who are being left behind and why. At the same time looking at who is left behind it can be investigated if children that struggle with financials are given assistance can they succeed.
