		<h2>Mission</h2>
	
		<p>
		Shed light on motor racing and the expenses that go into starting a career in the sport. Look at who the children are that have the opportunity and if there are resources available to those who want to continue.
		</p>
		<h2>Questions/ Rationale</h2>
		<p>
	How is indoor go-karting making auto racing more accessible to children that would otherwise not be able to participate in the sport?
			<br>
Are more women joining the sport?
			<br>
If indoor go-kart racing is something that people can afford to do then that is directly connected to the issue being researched, of how to make motor racing more accessible to people.
