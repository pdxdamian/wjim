		<h2>Importance</h2>
		<p>The topic of motor racing and making it more financially accessible is important for a variety of reasons. Motor racing has historically been a sport reserved mostly for the rich. People who do not have the financial ability to finance the early stages of a career don't get anywhere. The most successful Formula One driver, Lewis Hamilton had humble beginnings and is not a seven-time world champion, he has spoken on the issues that arose in his youth years and how difficult it was to get started even with immense skill. It is important to give children a chance to learn and improve through their youth years to give them a chance in the sport.</p>
