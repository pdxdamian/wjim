		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Formula 1 was initiated in 1950 and since then it has evolved into a mega worldwide sport. Formula 1 has ten teams that each make two cars to race every year. Out of the 20 drivers that compete every year the sport has featured many drivers from many backgrounds, religions, and race. Since the 1950s the cars have evolved to be the fastest racing cars in the world where ten teams travel across the globe each year in a 23 race calendar. The sport for a long time was considered to be for the wealthy only to enjoy. Until 2016 with the acquisition of formula 1 by Liberty Media, formula 1 has gained an estimated 75 million new fans and each year new attendance records are being broken in the main events.

		<h2>History of Issue</h2>
		<p>Formula one has had many drivers since its inception, these drivers were from all over the world. What is common among most drivers throughout the years especially those that go on to have successful careers is that most had sufficient financial backing since they were children. This has led to the stigma that only the rich can get into the sport. Until the past decade with Lewis Hamiltion winning seven world championships, the issue of financial backing for children to join the sport became a topic of debate. With him coming from humble beginnings he has advocated for more opportunities for kids to start motor racing.

		<h3>
		“It goes to the fundamentals of how the sport is governed. There are so many aspects that are not being tackled. There are only wealthy kids coming through. There are no kids from working-class families.”
